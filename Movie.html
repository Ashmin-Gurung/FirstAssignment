    <p>
        I do have lots of movies that i personally like and among them one "A writer's odyssey" is one. A Writer's
        Odyssey is a 2021 Chinese action-adventure fantasy film directed and written by Lu Yang and
        produced by Ning Hao. The film was released February 12, 2021, on the Lunar New Year. The film is based on
        Shuang Xuetao's novel of the same name, and its sequel Godslayer.
        <br>
    <h4>Plot</h4>
    The film follows Guan Ning as he searches for his daughter, believing her to be kidnapped by human traffickers.
    Soon, a powerful corporation contacts him and offers to find his daughter if he assassinates Lu Kongwen, a young
    novelist. The plot of his novel involves a young hero attempting to overthrow Redmane, their tyrannical ruler.
    Somehow, the novel appears to be impacting life in the real world, and the CEO, who suspects it as his bane, wants
    Lu dead.
