    <p>
        My hobby is listening to music with a bit of singing. Music is a universal language. Whether it’s playing an
        instrument or listening to music,
        it’s a fun and enjoyable hobby. People have been associating music with their moods and emotions for ages.
        Listening to music is a great
        hobby because it is good for both your mind and body. It can be very relaxing and enjoyable. On the other hand,
        music helps relieve stress, anxiety, and improve your mood at the same time.
